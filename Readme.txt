1. CNN_AP.pynb
- To run this file, all PM2.5 values,along with timestamp amd mapId are required.
- Import all files starting with "data" in the data folder
- The results shown in the pynb file are for 100 epochs and 0.0001 learning rate. 
- The results for CNN are not very good, Had the data been larger, the results would have been better.

2. Hybrid_Model
- To run this file, all PM2.5 values along with weather values are required.
- Import all files starting with "aqi" and "weather" from the data folder.
-The result are shown when alpha is set to 0.3, iterations = 10000, timesteps = 48

3. LSTM_Univariate
- To run this file, only PM2.5 values are required.
- Import all files starting with "aqi" from data folder.
